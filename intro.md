# Substitutions

**Whole Wheat Flour** in place of flour, adding `1 T` wheat gluten per cup of
flour for texture


# Egg Replacer

If a recipe calls for egg (replacer) and salt or baking soda, mixing the powders
before adding water helps to prevent clumping. This also applies to corn starch
and spice mixes.


# Silpat

Adjust baking times up by 10-15% as the silpat tends to insulate the bottom
of the food compared to baking directly on the pan.
