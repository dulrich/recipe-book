# Beans (Dry) #

This is a general guide, not a specific recipe.
The most important notes are soak at least six hours, drain the soaking water, and **DO NOT** add any salt or spices until after cooking.
Added salt especially will prevent the beans from becoming tender.

## Ingredients ##
*	1-2		C	dry beans (black, red, pinto, or garbanzo are best)

## Directions ##
1.	Place beans in medium pot. 4-6qt slow cooker works well.
2.	Cover with water so there is 3/4-1" over the beans.
3.	Cover with lid and soak overnight, or at least 6 hours.
4.	Drain soaking water. Re-cover with fresh water. Do not add salt or spices.
5.	Simmer over Med-Lo heat (Hi on crock pot) 1-2 hours, until tender.
6.	Strain out beans. Serve or use in other recipe, such as hummus (garbanzo) or refrieds (pinto)
