# Bread Machine Bread #

## Ingredients ##
*	1 1/2	C	water (warm)
*	2		T	butter (softened)
*	4		C	flour
*	1/4		C	sugar
*	2		t	salt
*	2		T	powdered milk
*	2		t	active dry yeast

## Directions ##
1.	Add all ingredients to bread machine in the order given. Set to desired crust (2 lb. loaf).

## Sourdough Substitution ##
The exact substitution ratio will depend on how wet or dry your starter is kept.
A good place to start is using 1 C starter, while reducing the flour to 3 C and the water to 1 C + 2 T.
If this still rises and does not have enough Sourdough flavor, keep substituting at a similar ratio.
For problems with an insufficient rise in the bread machine, first try using a high-gluten "Bread Flour",
if you are not already. This may provide enough extra rise if the sourdough is too "heavy".
