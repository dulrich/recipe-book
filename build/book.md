# Substitutions

**Olive Oil**			in place of butter

**Whole Wheat Flour**	in place of flour, adding 1 T wheat gluten per cup of
flour for texture


# Egg Replacer

If a recipe calls for egg (replacer) and salt or baking soda, mixing the powders
before adding water helps to prevent clumping. This also applies to corn starch
and spice mixes.


# Silpat

Adjust baking times up by 10-15% as the silpat tends to insulate the bottom
of the food compared to baking directly on the pan.

# Bread Machine Bread

## Ingredients
*	1 1/2	C	water (warm)
*	2		T	butter (softened)
*	4		C	flour
*	2		T	sugar
*	2		t	salt
*	2		T	powdered milk
*	2		t	active dry yeast

## Bread Sticks
Double butter to 4T, omit powdered milk. After first rise, split dough in 8 or 16
parts, depending on desired size of breadsticks. Roll between hands into narrow
tubes, place on baking sheet for second rise. The breadsticks will come together
at the edges. Bake at 400 degrees for 20-30 minutes.

## Pizza Crust
Use olive oil instead of butter, omit powdered milk. Add an additional 1/2 C flour.

## Directions (Bread Machine)
1.	Add all ingredients to bread machine in the order given. Set to desired crust (2 lb. loaf).

## Directions (Oven)
1.	Mix all ingredients except water in a large bowl.
2.	Add water, knead until no flour remains.
3.	Cover and let rise, about 1 hour.
4.	Knead into desired shape, bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.

## Sourdough Substitution
The exact substitution ratio will depend on how wet or dry your starter is kept.
A good place to start is using 1 C starter, while reducing the flour to 3 C and the water to 1 C + 2 T.
If this still rises and does not have enough Sourdough flavor, keep substituting at a similar ratio.
For problems with an insufficient rise in the bread machine, first try using a high-gluten "Bread Flour",
if you are not already. This may provide enough extra rise if the sourdough is too "heavy".
